# task.js [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/icodeforlove/task.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/icodeforlove/task.js) [![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/icodeforlove/task.js.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/icodeforlove/task.js)
This modules is intended to make working with blocking tasks a bit easier, and is meant to work in node as well as the browser.

## install

```
	# node
	npm install task.js


	# browser
	bower install task

	or just grab the `/dist/client/task.min.js` file directly

```

## important

Before using this module I want to expose the current performance issues

- Node.js

	- When using task.js in node with very large messages it can be very slow, this is due to the fact that node is copying all the message data.

- Clientside
	- When using task.js in a browser that doesn't support transferables (or you don't use them properly) then you will notice a slow down when passing massive array buffers

Rule of thumb in node keep your object size under 150kb, and in the clientside version you can go crazy and send 40MB array buffers if transferables are supported.

## callbacks and promises

task.js supports both styles

```javascript
var powAsync = task.wrap(pow);

// callbacks
pow(2, function (error, result) {

});

// promises
pow(2).then(
	function (result) {},
	function (error) {}
);
```

## task.defaults (optional)

You can override the defaults like this

```javascript
// overriding defaults (optional)
var myCustomTask = task.defaults({
	debug: false, // extremely verbose, you should also set maxWorkers to 1
	warmStart: false, // (default: false, if set to true all workers will be initialized instantly)
	maxWorkers: 4, // (default: the system max, or 4 if it can't be resolved)
	idleTimeout: 10000, // (default: false)
	idleCheckInterval: 1000 // (default: null)
	globals: {}, // refer to globals information
	initialize: function (globals) {return globals;} // refer to globals information
});
```

behind the scenes it's spreading your dynamic work across your cores

## task.wrap

You can wrap a function if the method signatures match, and it doesn't rely on any external variables.

```javascript
// non async
function pow(number) {
	return Math.pow(number, 2);
}

var powAsync = task.wrap(pow);
powAsync(2).then(function (squaredNumber) {
	console.log(squaredNumber);
});
```

But keep in mind that your function cannot reference anything inside of your current scope because it is running inside of a worker.

## task.run

Below is an example of using a transferable

```javascript
var buffer = new ArrayBuffer();

task.run({
	arguments: [buffer, 1234],
	transferables: [buffer] // optional, and only supported client-side
	function: function (message) {
		return message.buffer;
	}
}).then(function (buffer) {
	console.log(buffer); // 4
});
```

## task.terminate

When you run terminate it will destroy all current workers in the pool, and throw an error on all outstanding work.

```javascript
task.terminate();
```

## globals in workers

You can initialize a task instance to have predefined data from your main thread, or generated within the worker.

```javascript
var data = {one: 1};

task.defaults({
	globals: {
		data: data,
		two: 2,
		three: 3
	}
})

task.wrap(function () {
	console.log(globals.data);
	console.log(globals.two);
	console.log(globals.three);
});
```

The above works great for small data, but with larger data this doesn't work. This is where you can use the initialize property in defaults.

```javascript
task.defaults({
	globals: {
		data: {one: 1}
	},
	initialize: function (globals) {
		globals.bigData = [];
		for (var i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
			globals.bigData.push(0);
		}
		return globals;
	}
});
```

You can also use initialize to define common methods in the worker scope as well.

```javascript
task.defaults({
	globals: {
		data: {one: 1}
	},
	initialize: function (globals) {
		globals.myFunc = function () {
			...
		}

		return globals;
	}
});
```

Keep in mind that it is ok to have a slow initialize, no work will actually be processed until there is a fully initialized worker.

## browser tests

## todo / help

- for node add shm buffer support or something, we need a nice way to deal with spreading the cores across large chunks of data
- add opensauce tests?
